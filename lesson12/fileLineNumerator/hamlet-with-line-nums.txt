1: To be, or not to be: that is the question:
2: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
3: The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
4: Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
5: And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
6: No more; and, by a sleep to say we end
7: The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
8: That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
9: Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
10: To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub.
